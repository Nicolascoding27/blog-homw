        ### What I am going to do with my luck?

Today is my 22nd birthday, honestly, this is not transcendental for me, but I took some time to reflect on how things had changed in the last years of my life, I concluded that I am extremely lucky so I asked myself what am I going to do with this luck?

This is a personal reflection of why I think most people ( including myself ) underestimate how lucky they are and then what I will do with this luck. 

Growing up in Bogota, Colombia, for me was like a bubble, I never saw what people  see in shows like Narcos and all of those **cheap representations** of what Colombia is ( according to them just drugs, soccer, and murdering).

After traveling to different places in Colombia, I realized that people’s reality was different from mine, I saw people living  in informal brick houses ( image 1 ) and some of them did not have clean water or electricity.

 I started to talk to more people about what I saw and a conversation changed my life completely I talked to one of my friends in school and he explained to me that he had to walk for about 1 hour  to get to our school (. because he did not have enough money to take the bus ), he also told me that he had a scholarship in our school because his mom had a mental disorder and could not work and his dad left him when he was 3 weeks old. At this moment I saw how ignorant and lucky I was, I understood that the only reason I speak 4 languages and have more ambition than my peers is because of luck, **“ It is hard to find the meaning of life when you are hungry”**

CLOSE WITH CONCLUSION FROM PROSPERITY PARADOX

Since then I have been trying to answer a question -what can I do about it- most of it is focusing on. bringing more opportunities to them. and to my country. This focus to the outside helped me to change from what am I missing in my life to this are all the tools that iI can use and i am luckier than 99% of Colombia , so I have the responsibility of giving g back that luck. Until now that is the purpose of everything I do from the small to the “big”: actions that from my perspective would never be enough if i do it alone.
